I have recently graduated with a Ph.D. in Applied Machine Learning (Computer Science) from the University of Massachusetts Boston and am now looking for the role that will begin the next chapter of my career.

For the last four years I have worked as a Research Assistant in the Knowledge Discovery Lab at UMB, where we took on a variety of data science and machine learning projects in support of collaborators across a variety of disciplines, including human activity recognition, flood risk prediction, irrigation mapping, and many others. 

In terms of modeling, I’ve been focused on deep neural networks in PyTorch recently but have used a breadth of ML techniques over my time in the Ph.D. program and during my Data Science internship at Indigo Ag, where I developed and trained a field-level irrigation prediction model using satellite imagery and associated weather data. 

Additionally, prior to my return to academia, I worked as an AVP in Catastrophe Risk Modeling (commercial property) at Allied World Assurance, where my team and I were responsible for collecting and maintaining the store of the company’s in-force direct property building data and providing views and metrics to upper management to inform risk mitigation strategy. 

I'm just getting things spun up on this personal site, and plan to be putting up articles on previous projects and new directions in the coming weeks.
