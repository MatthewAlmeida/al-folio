abstract = {The study of model bias and variance with respect to decision boundaries is critically
important in supervised learning and artificial intelligence. There is generally a
tradeoff between the two, as fine-tuning of the decision boundary of a classification
model to accommodate more boundary training samples (i.e., higher model complexity)
may improve training accuracy (i.e., lower bias) but hurt generalization against unseen
data (i.e., higher variance). By focusing on just classification boundary fine-tuning
and model complexity, it is difficult to reduce both bias and variance. To overcome
this dilemma, we take a different perspective and investigate a new approach to handle
inaccuracy and uncertainty in the training data labels, which are inevitable in many
applications where labels are conceptual entities and labeling is performed by human
annotators. The process of classification can be undermined by uncertainty in the
labels of the training data; extending a boundary to accommodate an inaccurately labeled
point will increase both bias and variance. Our novel method can reduce both bias
and variance by estimating the pointwise label uncertainty of the training set and
accordingly adjusting the training sample weights such that those samples with high
uncertainty are weighted down and those with low uncertainty are weighted up. In this
way, uncertain samples have a smaller contribution to the objective function of the
model’s learning algorithm and exert less pull on the decision boundary. In a real-world
physical activity recognition case study, the data present many labeling challenges,
and we show that this new approach improves model performance and reduces model variance.},

abstract = {The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization reports that irrigated 
agriculture accounts for 20 percent of the world's cultivated land and 40% of 
the produced food, with 324M hectares equipped for irrigation and 275M actually 
irrigated. Despite its prevalence, mapping irrigation at high resolution is 
challenging due to data availability and aggregation to large administrative 
regions, limiting its utility for field-scale analyses. Our goal is to design 
a low latency global framework capable of identifying irrigated areas at fine 
spatial resolution via predictive modeling. To that end, we transformed three 
years of proprietary irrigation data (2016-2019) over corn, cotton and soybean 
fields farmed in the US into ground truth labels and used them to train a 
classification model. Features were extracted from the Harmonized Landsat 
Sentinel-2 (HLS) product and combined with weather data from the gridMET dataset. 
HLS was used to derive composite images of vegetation and water indices at a 30 
m spatial resolution for early-, middle- and late-growing-season time periods, 
which correspond to the phenology windows of spring crops in the continental US. 
The NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) was used to filter images for corn, cotton 
and soybean pixels for a given year. In addition to the remote-sensing based 
features, summaries of accumulated precipitation and growing degree days from 
gridMET were included in the model to serve as both a proxy for geography and a 
complement to the information contained in the HLS-based water index. Our current 
tree-based classification approach predicts irrigation status on a pixel level, 
which allows for the creation of large-scale maps without requiring field boundaries. 
However, when boundaries are available, the pixel-level predictions can be aggregated 
to a field-level prediction via a voting procedure, yielding a field-level prediction 
with an immediate, and interpretable uncertainty. Pixel-level predictions are also 
valuable for their ability to respond to subfield variability. Future work will 
incorporate similar training data from farmed land in South America and Australia, with 
the expectation that more diverse training data will widen the model’s applicability 
and move us closer to a globally performant irrigation mapping system.},

  abstract = {Crime is a major social problem in the United States, threatening public safety 
  and disrupting the economy. Understanding patterns in criminal activity allows for the 
  prediction of future high-risk crime "hot spots" and enables police precincts to more 
  effectively allocate officers to prevent or respond to incidents. With the ever-increasing 
  ability of states and organizations to collect and store detailed data tracking crime occurrence, a significant amount of data with spatial and temporal information has been collected. How to use the benefit of massive spatial-temporal information to precisely predict the regional crime rates becomes necessary. The recurrent neural network model has been widely proven effective for detecting the temporal patterns in a time series. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal neural network (STNN) to precisely forecast crime hot spots with embedding spatial information. We evaluate the model using call-for-service data provided by the Portland, Oregon Police Bureau (PPB) for a 5-year period from March 2012 through the end of December 2016. We show that our STNN model outperforms a number of classical machine learning approaches and some alternative neural network architectures.
